This is a minimal example of live reload for JavaScript.

Use `npm run watch` to start the server.

Use `npm run live` to start
[livereload](https://www.npmjs.com/package/livereload).

Point a browser at (http://localhost:1337). Any changes made to files
in the `app` directory will cause the page to reload.
